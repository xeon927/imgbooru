What is this?
-------------
Pretty much, this is just my take at a Danbooru clone. It's not meant to be the best around, or anything like that. I just wanted a little project to work on, and have it done my way. I'm not doing this only to write it though - it will actually get used by myself privately. Feel free to use it if you want, I guess?

Current Ideas
-------------
Compared to pretty much every other Danbooru clone available, this one probably won't have certain features:
* Commenting
* Voting

The reasoning behind this is that seeing as this project is for my own personal use, just mainly for storing and categorising images, I don't require these features. Maybe someday down the line, I might add these features in, in addition to an option to disable certain features. But that isn't decided as of yet.

Timeline
--------
Currently there's no set timeframe for when this project will be in a usable state. I'm just kind of rolling with it and seeing where it goes. If it gets finished, that's a bonus. If I give up along the way, well, I'll probably delete this repo. Oh well.
